# ServiceNow_RetroLibrary

Hi everyone, 



What began as an exploration of widget development, API integration, and dynamic data in ServiceNow quickly evolved into a fully functional book discovery experience â€” powered by the Google Books API.



Built entirely on the ServiceNow platform, Retro Library features:



ðŸ“š Custom Service Portal widgets

 ðŸ“š Integration with external APIs using RESTMessageV2

 ðŸ“š A custom Favorites table for user-specific data

 ðŸ“š Dynamic UI with modals, feedback notifications, and data binding.

 ðŸ“š Server-side logic via Script Includes

 ðŸ“š A custom theme for the portal - I called it Fun Retro Theme



Users can search for books, view details, and save favorites â€” all within a clean, responsive Service Portal experience.

What started as an experiment became a rewarding way to apply ServiceNow architecture to something I care about â€” books.
